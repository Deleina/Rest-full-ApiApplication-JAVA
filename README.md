# Rest-full-ApiApplication-JAVA

The Java project I developed focused on learning how to create a RESTful API using HTTP requests and HTTP methods. Through this project, I explored how to implement endpoints using Java libraries to handle HTTP requests and responses, allowing interaction with resources and data through operations such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. The main objective was to understand and apply the fundamental principles of a RESTful API, learning how to design and manage its functionalities using Java and the corresponding HTTP operations.
